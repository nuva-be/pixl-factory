/**
 * Pure-frontend simulation of a workflow walk.
 *
 * Given a draft + a cursor (which node is "active" right now and which have
 * been "done"), `nextStep` returns the next node to visit. The semantics
 * are intentionally lightweight — the goal is to give the canvas something
 * to animate, not to faithfully replay every pixl-factory engine behaviour:
 *
 * - Diamond / multiple-out branches → pick the first outgoing edge with a
 *   `condition`, falling back to the first non-self-loop edge.
 * - Hexagon (human gate) → walk through, no pause. Pause UX lives in v2.
 * - Loop edges (a node visited more than once via the same edge) → take
 *   the first outgoing edge whose target hasn't hit `max_visits` yet.
 * - Cycle break → stop after `MAX_TOTAL_STEPS` total visits in case the
 *   graph has no path to `exit`.
 *
 * Pure function; the React layer's play-button drives the cadence with
 * `setInterval`.
