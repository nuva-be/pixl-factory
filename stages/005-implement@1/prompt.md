Goal: # Agent Context Observability Events Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Add durable API/backend events that report loaded memory files, discovered and activated skills, and per-server MCP tool names for agent runs.

**Architecture:** Keep this API-backend scoped. Emit typed `AgentEvent` variants from the existing `fabro-agent` initialization and skill activation paths, convert them through `fabro-workflow` into durable `fabro-types` run events, and document the event contracts. Do not add run projection fields in this pass; consumers can read the event stream/history.

**Tech Stack:** Rust, Serde, Fabro agent/session events, Fabro workflow event conversion, Fabro MCP connection manager, `cargo nextest`.

---

## Scope

Implement these event changes:

- Add `agent.memory.loaded` with memory file paths, byte counts, loaded byte counts, truncation flags, provider profile, total loaded bytes, and budget bytes.
- Add `agent.skills.discovered` with source directories, provider profile, and sorted skill summaries.
- Add persisted `agent.skill.activated` for slash skill expansion and successful `use_skill` tool calls.
- Enrich `agent.mcp.ready` with names-only tool summaries: qualified tool name and original server tool name.

Do not implement ACP-native equivalents in this pass. Do not include memory file contents in any event payload. Do not include MCP tool descriptions or schemas.

## Existing Patterns To Follow

- Read `docs/internal/events-strategy.md` before changing event variants, names, conversion, or progress JSONL behavior.
- Read `docs/internal/testing-strategy.md` before adding or reorganizing tests.
- Follow the current `AgentEvent` flow:
  - `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/types.rs`
  - `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/session.rs`
  - `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/handler/llm/api.rs`
  - `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/event/convert.rs`
  - `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/event/names.rs`
  - `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/run_event/agent.rs`
  - `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/run_event/mod.rs`
- Follow Rust import style from `AGENTS.md`: import types by name, import functions through their parent module, and avoid glob imports in production code.

## File Map

- Modify `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/run_event/agent.rs`: add new prop structs and extend `AgentMcpReadyProps`.
- Modify `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/run_event/mod.rs`: add `EventBody` variants for the new event names.
- Modify `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/types.rs`: add internal `AgentEvent` variants, trace output, and noise filtering decisions.
- Modify `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/memory.rs`: return memory content plus metadata instead of bare strings.
- Modify `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/session.rs`: emit memory, skills, skill activation, and enriched MCP events.
- Modify `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/skills.rs`: emit tool-sourced skill activation from `use_skill`.
- Modify `lib/crates/fabro-mcp/src/connection_manager.rs`: expose or support deterministic names-only tool summaries per server.
- Modify `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/event/convert.rs`: convert new agent events to durable event bodies.
- Modify `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/event/names.rs`: add event names.
- Modify `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/event/events.rs` only if the agent event name mapping also lives there for these variants.
- Modify `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/event/stored_fields.rs` only if a new event needs non-standard stored fields; otherwise rely on existing `Event::Agent` handling.
- Modify `docs/internal/events.md`: document new event shapes and the richer MCP payload.
- Add or update tests in `lib/crates/fabro-agent`, `lib/crates/fabro-mcp`, `lib/crates/fabro-types`, and `lib/crates/fabro-workflow`.

### Task 1: Add Typed Durable Event Contracts

**Files:**
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/run_event/agent.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/run_event/mod.rs`
- Test: existing `fabro-types` run event serde tests, or add focused coverage near the existing run event tests.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add agent memory props**

Add event prop structs with this shape:

```rust
pub struct AgentMemoryLoadedProps {
    pub provider_profile:  String,
    pub files:             Vec<AgentMemoryFileProps>,
    pub total_loaded_bytes: usize,
    pub budget_bytes:      usize,
    pub visit:             u32,
}

pub struct AgentMemoryFileProps {
    pub path:         String,
    pub byte_count:   usize,
    pub loaded_bytes: usize,
    pub truncated:    bool,
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add skill props**

Add skill discovery and activation props:

```rust
pub struct AgentSkillsDiscoveredProps {
    pub provider_profile: String,
    pub source_dirs:      Vec<String>,
    pub skills:           Vec<AgentSkillSummary>,
    pub visit:            u32,
}

pub struct AgentSkillSummary {
    pub name:        String,
    pub description: String,
}

pub enum AgentSkillActivationSource {
    Slash,
    Tool,
}

pub struct AgentSkillActivatedProps {
    pub skill_name: String,
    pub source:     AgentSkillActivationSource,
    pub visit:      u32,
}
```

Use serde names `slash` and `tool` for `AgentSkillActivationSource`. If a local enum string pattern already exists, follow that pattern.

- [ ] **Step 3: Extend MCP ready props**

Extend `AgentMcpReadyProps` with a backwards-compatible field:

```rust
#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Vec::is_empty")]
pub tools: Vec<AgentMcpToolSummary>,
```

Add:

```rust
pub struct AgentMcpToolSummary {
    pub name:          String,
    pub original_name: String,
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add EventBody variants**

Add `EventBody` variants using these serialized event names:

- `agent.memory.loaded`
- `agent.skills.discovered`
- `agent.skill.activated`

Keep existing `agent.mcp.ready` name unchanged and only enrich its props.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add serde tests**

Cover:

- New event names serialize to the expected dot names.
- `AgentSkillActivationSource` serializes as `slash` and `tool`.
- Old `agent.mcp.ready` JSON without `tools` still deserializes with `tools == []`.

---

### Task 2: Add Internal Agent Events And Conversion

**Files:**
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/types.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/event/convert.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/event/names.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-workflow/src/event/events.rs` if needed by the existing name mapping.
- Test: `lib/crates/fabro-workflow` event conversion tests.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add internal AgentEvent variants**

Add variants equivalent to:

```rust
MemoryLoaded {
    provider_profile: String,
    files: Vec<MemoryFileSummary>,
    total_loaded_bytes: usize,
    budget_bytes: usize,
}

SkillsDiscovered {
    provider_profile: String,
    source_dirs: Vec<String>,
    skills: Vec<SkillSummary>,
}

SkillActivated {
    skill_name: String,
    source: SkillActivationSource,
}

McpServerReady {
    server_name: String,
    tool_count: usize,
    tools: Vec<McpToolSummary>,
}
```

Prefer small shared internal structs near `AgentEvent` if that matches the existing file organization.

- [ ] **Step 2: Persist skill activation**

Do not classify `SkillActivated` as streaming noise. The existing `SkillExpanded` event is currently filtered before persistence; replace slash expansion emissions with `SkillActivated { source: Slash }` or keep `SkillExpanded` internal-only if removing it would create unnecessary churn.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add trace behavior**

Update `AgentEvent::trace` so the new events emit concise tracing summaries:

- memory loaded: profile, file count, total loaded bytes, budget bytes
- skills discovered: profile, skill count, source dir count
- skill activated: name and source
- MCP ready: server, count, and summary count

- [ ] **Step 4: Convert to durable events**

Update `fabro-workflow` event conversion so the new agent events map to the new `fabro-types` props and include `visit`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add conversion tests**

Cover each new event with a focused conversion assertion that checks:

- durable event name
- `visit`
- core fields
- no memory content in the converted payload

---

### Task 3: Emit Memory Loaded Metadata

**Files:**
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/memory.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/session.rs`
- Test: relevant `fabro-agent` memory/session tests.

- [ ] **Step 1: Change memory discovery return type**

Change memory discovery from bare `Vec<String>` to a document type carrying both prompt content and event metadata:

```rust
pub struct MemoryDocument {
    pub path:         String,
    pub content:      String,
    pub byte_count:   usize,
    pub loaded_bytes: usize,
    pub truncated:    bool,
}
```

Keep existing behavior unchanged:

- provider profile filename candidates stay the same
- root-to-working-dir walk stays the same
- content dedupe stays the same
- empty files are skipped
- total budget remains 32 KiB
- truncated content keeps the existing truncation marker

- [ ] **Step 2: Preserve prompt assembly behavior**

Adjust session/profile prompt assembly to pass only memory contents where prompt assembly expects memory text. The system prompt should be byte-for-byte equivalent except where existing tests allow non-semantic ordering differences.

- [ ] **Step 3: Emit agent.memory.loaded**

In `Session::initialize()`, emit `AgentEvent::MemoryLoaded` immediately after memory discovery, before skills and MCP initialization.

Emit the event even when no memory files are loaded. That lets consumers distinguish "no memory" from "not reported."

- [ ] **Step 4: Add memory tests**

Cover:

- loaded file path appears in event metadata
- `byte_count` is the original file byte count
- `loaded_bytes` reflects bytes actually loaded into the prompt budget
- `truncated` is true only for truncated files
- event payload never contains memory file contents
- empty discovery still emits a memory-loaded event with `files == []`

---

### Task 4: Emit Skills Discovered And Skill Activated

**Files:**
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/session.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/skills.rs`
- Test: relevant `fabro-agent` skill/session tests.

- [ ] **Step 1: Emit skills discovered**

After `discover_skills(...)`, emit `AgentEvent::SkillsDiscovered` with:

- `provider_profile`
- `source_dirs`
- sorted `skills: [{ name, description }]`

Emit the event even when no skills are discovered.

- [ ] **Step 2: Emit slash activation**

Where slash skill expansion currently emits or creates `SkillExpanded`, emit:

```rust
AgentEvent::SkillActivated {
    skill_name,
    source: SkillActivationSource::Slash,
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Emit tool activation**

In `make_use_skill_tool`, use `ToolContext::emit_agent_event(...)` after a requested skill is found and before returning the skill template. Emit:

```rust
AgentEvent::SkillActivated {
    skill_name: name.to_string(),
    source: SkillActivationSource::Tool,
}
```

Do not emit activation for failed `use_skill` lookups.

- [ ] **Step 4: Add skill tests**

Cover:

- discovery event includes all discovered skills sorted by name
- discovery event includes configured source directories
- empty discovery emits `skills == []`
- slash expansion emits `source == slash`
- successful `use_skill` emits `source == tool`
- failed `use_skill` does not emit activation

---

### Task 5: Enrich agent.mcp.ready With Names-Only Tool Summaries

**Files:**
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-mcp/src/connection_manager.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-agent/src/session.rs`
- Test: relevant `fabro-mcp` or `fabro-agent` MCP tests.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add deterministic tool summaries**

Expose a helper on `McpConnectionManager` or compute in `Session` from `all_tools()`:

- filter tools by `server_name`
- return qualified tool name as `name`
- return server-provided tool name as `original_name`
- sort by qualified `name`

- [ ] **Step 2: Enrich ready emissions**

When emitting `AgentEvent::McpServerReady`, include the tool summaries for that server. Keep existing `server_name` and `tool_count`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add MCP tests**

Cover:

- ready event includes only tools from the ready server
- summaries are sorted by qualified name
- `name` is the Fabro-qualified MCP tool name
- `original_name` is the server-provided tool name
- descriptions and input schemas are not included

---

### Task 6: Update Event Documentation

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/internal/events.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Document new events**

Add sections for:

- `agent.memory.loaded`
- `agent.skills.discovered`
- `agent.skill.activated`

For `agent.memory.loaded`, explicitly state that file contents are excluded.

- [ ] **Step 2: Update MCP ready docs**

Update `agent.mcp.ready` to show:

```json
{
  "server_name": "github",
  "tool_count": 2,
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "mcp__github__create_issue",
      "original_name": "create_issue"
    }
  ],
  "visit": 1
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Record skill event replacement**

If `agent.skill.expanded` remains in internal code or docs, mark it internal-only or replaced by `agent.skill.activated`.

---

### Task 7: Verify

**Files:**
- No new files unless test placement requires it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run focused tests**

Run:

```bash
cargo nextest run -p fabro-agent -p fabro-workflow -p fabro-types -p fabro-mcp
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run formatting**

Run:

```bash
cargo +nightly-2026-04-14 fmt --all
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run clippy for touched crates or workspace**

Prefer the workspace command if time permits:

```bash
cargo +nightly-2026-04-14 clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Final sanity checks**

Confirm:

- memory events never contain file contents
- skills discovered and memory loaded are emitted even for empty lists
- skill activation is persisted rather than filtered as streaming noise
- `agent.mcp.ready` remains backwards-compatible for old events without `tools`
- docs match the serialized event names and payload shapes
